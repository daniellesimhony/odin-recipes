    <p>
        A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterior.
