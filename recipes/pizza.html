    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups (454g) water, lukewarm</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (12g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (9g) active dry yeast or instant yeast, or 1 packet active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (18g) salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25g) olive oil, optional</li>
        <li>5 1/2 to 6 cups (660g to 720g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or King Arthur Pizza Flour Blend, enough to make a soft, smooth dough</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (12g) King Arthur Pizza Dough Flavor, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Dissolve the sugar, yeast, and salt in the lukewarm water (and olive oil, if you're using it).
        </li>
        <li>

            Add the flour and Pizza Dough Flavor, starting with 5 1/2 cups (660g) flour and adding more as necessary to make a soft, smooth dough.
        </li>
        <li>

            Knead the dough (with your hands, a mixer, or your bread machine set on the dough cycle) until it's smooth and elastic, about 7 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other container, cover it, and let it rise for 1 to 2 hours, whatever fits your schedule.</li>
        <li>

            Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into four pieces, for medium-crust pizza; or three pieces, for thicker crusts. Use a rolling pin to roll each piece, on a lightly greased surface, into a circle to fit a 12" pizza pan. Let the dough rest several times to relax it and make it more cooperative. If you prefer a more artisan look to your crust, with scattered random air pockets throughout, hand-stretch the dough to size. Again, letting it rest periodically makes the job easier.
        </li>
        <li>

            Place the rounds on pizza pans; on baking sheets; or, if you have a pizza stone in your oven, on parchment.
        </li>
        <li>

            Preheat your oven to 450°F. While it's heating, get out your toppings, which you've prepared ahead. Some possibilities include sliced pepperoni; sautéed mushrooms, onions, or peppers; cooked meats; olives; anchovies; and grated or shredded cheese.
        </li>
        <li>

            Brush each crust with a bit of olive oil; spread pizza or spaghetti sauce lightly over the surface, and let your guests add their favorite toppings. Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.
        </li>
        <li>

            Bake the pizzas for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown, the toppings are hot and bubbly, and the cheese is melted. Remove the pizzas from the oven.
        </li>
        <li>

            Immediately transfer pizzas to a cooling rack, so their bottoms don't get soggy. After about 10 minutes (to allow the toppings to set), slice and serve; a pair of scissors is a great cutting tool.
